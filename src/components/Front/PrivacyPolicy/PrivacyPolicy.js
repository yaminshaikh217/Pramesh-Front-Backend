              <p className='text-center'>Cord was formed to establish a linking force that bridges the gap between the past and the present. Co-founded by Pranav Guglani and Neha Singh, the brand rooted in 2015 with an ideology to depict stories with skilled Indian artisans and their craftsmanship along with the beauty of authenticity, and the charm of nostalgia.

The need to focus more on quality than quantity led our creative process to be defined by durability, comfort, and functionality with hints of details inspired by vintage fashion.

Our practice of launching only two main collections annually comes from our the dogma of not following trends, but to further encourage seasonless and classic designs that remain with you forever.

We love our products to be interpreted by the personality of the user, whether it's our garment being dressed up or down, or the way our leather bag matures with age and wherever it travels. With a complete mix of contemporary clothing and handcrafted leather goods, we hope to offer a lifestyle that does not only look restored but feels relevant.</p>
